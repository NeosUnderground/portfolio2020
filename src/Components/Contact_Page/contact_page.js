                        My name is James Kubitz. Iâ€™m an ambitious web developer who is actively improving my skillset. I am eager to continuously learn about my field of study and stay up to date with the latest technologies, often spending hours conducting independent research and teaching myself. Programming is a passion of mine as I enjoy the satisfaction of turning a concept into reality, taking pride in the finished product.
